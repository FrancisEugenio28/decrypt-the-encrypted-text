#Problem 2: Lab Exercise 1

# Create a input for user
# Create a list of substitutions wherein this will be the basis of our program to decrypt the text
# Create an empty list wherein it accepts the decrypted text
# With the use of "For Loop", we command that every special text included in the input must be replace with their specific equivalent in the list of substitutions
# Else just copy the char from the input then return the output
# print the output
